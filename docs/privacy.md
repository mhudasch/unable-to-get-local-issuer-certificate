### GitHub

This website is powered by Jekyll and is hosted on GitHub. Github, (like any hosting company) can have full insight in visitor data, like connecting IP addresses, visited pages, etc. Note that Github is not known to actively profile visitors. By using a VPN you can (try to) prevent this.
