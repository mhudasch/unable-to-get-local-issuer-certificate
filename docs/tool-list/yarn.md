## All Platforms

### Yarn 1.x

Yarn 1.x takes many configurations directly from Npm by reading the `.npmrc` and supports the Node.js environment variables. For that reason you can follow the guid for npm [here]({{ '/tools/npm' | relative_url }}).

### Yarn 2.x

Yarn 2.x doesn't use the configuration from your `.npmrc` files anymore; it instead reads all of the configuration from the `.yarnrc.yml` files whose available settings can be found [here](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc). The `.yarnrc.yml` file must be placed inside your Node.js project and not inside your user directory in order to work correctly.

This means that configurations for certificates must be done inside `.yarnrc.yml`. You can configure Yarn to use a central trusted CA certificate bundle file in [pem - Base64 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-Enhanced_Mail) using the following entry in the config file:

```yaml
# .yarnrc.yml

caFilePath: "<path to pem file>"
```

The path to the pem file can be absolute or relative.
{: .note }

Another configuration would be `httpsCertFilePath` which works like `caFilePath` but for the whole SSL certificate chain and not only the trusted root CA certificate. So if you have problems with intermediate certificates, this would be the place to check.

**Do not** use settings like `yarn config set enableStrictSsl false` or `npm config set strict-ssl false` because they disable the security feature completely even if you are using a self-signed certificate. It is always better to secure the SSL connection by making a certificate known to npm/Node.js.
